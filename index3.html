        <p><strong> Firstly:</strong> 

we must peel the banana and brown it in a pan with a little butter. We withdraw and reserve. 
On the other hand we cook the rice in salt water for 18 minutes. Once the rice is made, what we will do will be to saute it with a little olive oil and a garlic so that it takes a little flavor.

</p>
         <p><strong>Secondly:</strong> Regarding the fried tomato, I pass you my homemade fried tomato recipe right now, although you can use the typical pot. In my opinion, if you have the opportunity to make it home much better.
Fry the two eggs in abundant hot oil (really fried, not grilled).</p>

         <p><strong> Finally:</strong> We planted as my grandmother used to do, with a cup we make “the little mountain”, that's what she affectionately called and we accompanied the two fried eggs and the banana. We cover homemade fried tomato and eat with a good piece of bread.
Bake, covered, 25 minutes.

        <h2 id="recipe2"> Barbecue pizza</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Time: 25 minutes</li>
            <li>Serves: 1 adult </li>
        </ul>

            </tbody>
        </table>
        
        <p><strong>Firstly:</strong> We put equal parts barbecue sauce and tomato sauce.
Cover with grated cheese.

</p>
         <p><strong>Secondly:</strong> Chop the chicken fillet and the bacon. We cover the pizza with meat, bacon and chicken.
</p>

 <p><strong>Finally:</strong> Bake for 15 minutes at 220º or until crispy.
</p>

        <h2 id="recipe3">Macaroni carbonara</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Time: 25 min</li>
            <li>Serves: 3 adults</li>
        </ul>
        
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Ingredients</th>
                    <th>Quantity</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        
        <p><strong>Firstly:</strong> We cook the pasta. Once cooked, drain and mix with a spoonful of butter.
While the pasta is cooking, sauté the bacon in small cubes in a frying pan with the other spoonful of butter. When it is crispy and takes on colour, it is time to add the liquid cream if you are going to put it in. Mix well and add salt and pepper to taste.

</p>
         <p><strong>Secondly:</strong> Add the cooked pasta and turn it over a few times. The cream is almost absorbed by the paste.
Mix the beaten egg with the yolk, salt and pepper in a bowl and add it to the pasta. Remove from the heat and stir until the sauce begins to thicken. The point of the carbonara is that the egg does not completely set, but remains creamy.
</p>

 <p><strong>Finally:</strong> Serve freshly made, sprinkled with Parmesan or grated Pecorino if you like and a little chopped chives.
